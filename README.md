# Smart-Energy-Consumption
The"Smart Energy Consumption"(SEC)project solves the problem of unwanted consumption and wastage of energy in our day-to-day life using Motion(PIR-PassiveInfrared)sensor,Light Intensity(LDR-LightDependentResistor)sensor and Flamesensor and other various sensors respectively along with ArduinoUNO to tackle the above mentioned problem.
This project can be implemented different areas at different sclaes for exmaple Classrooms,Lecture halls,Auditoriums,Laboratories as well as in our homes and buildings.
This "SEC SYSTEM" is cost affordable and everyone can make use of it. 
This project helps a lot to reduce pollution, conserves energy, make a sustainable Earth and cost optimization of electricity bills. 
This project is also very helpful for physically-handicapped persons as they don't have to make efforts to turn-ON/OFF switches,as this "SEC-SYSTEM" is auto-switching and is autonomous and independent.
